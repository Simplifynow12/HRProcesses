# SOP Delete Functionality Demo

## Overview
This demo shows the implementation of SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) deletion functionality that is only available to superadmin users.

## How to Test

### 1. Login as Superadmin
- Username: `superadmin`
- Password: `superpass`
- Navigate to "SOP Management" section

### 2. Verify Delete Button Visibility
- You should see a red delete icon (trash can) next to each SOP
- The delete icon should appear alongside the view, edit, and download icons
- Hover over the delete icon to see "Delete SOP" tooltip

### 3. Test Delete Functionality
1. Click the red delete icon on any SOP
2. A confirmation dialog should appear with:
   - Title: "Confirm Deletion"
   - Message: "Are you sure you want to delete SOP '[SOP Title]'? This action cannot be undone."
   - Two buttons: "Cancel" and "Delete"
3. Click "Cancel" to abort the deletion
4. Click the delete icon again and then click "Delete" to confirm
5. The SOP should be removed from the list

### 4. Test Role-Based Access Control
1. Logout and login as a different user:
   - Username: `admin` (operations_lead role)
   - Password: `admin123`
2. Navigate to "SOP Management"
3. Verify that NO delete icons are visible
4. Only view, edit, and download icons should be present

### 5. Test Multiple Deletions
1. Login as superadmin again
2. Delete multiple SOPs in sequence
3. Verify each deletion works independently
4. Verify the list updates correctly after each deletion

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/SOPManagement.tsx` - Added delete functionality
2. `src/App.tsx` - Updated to pass user role to SOPManagement
3. `user_stories/user-story-sop-delete.md` - New user story documentation

### Key Features
- **Role-based access**: Only superadmin can see delete buttons
- **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Visual feedback**: Red delete icon indicates destructive action
- **Consistent UI**: Follows existing Material-UI patterns

### Security Considerations
- Delete functionality is restricted to superadmin role only
- Confirmation dialog provides clear warning about irreversible action
- Role checking is implemented at both component and UI levels

## Expected Behavior

### For Superadmin Users:
- ✅ Can see delete icons for all SOPs
- ✅ Can click delete icon to open confirmation dialog
- ✅ Can cancel deletion via dialog
- ✅ Can confirm deletion to permanently remove SOP
- ✅ Can delete multiple SOPs in sequence

### For Non-Superadmin Users:
- ✅ Cannot see delete icons
- ✅ Can still view, edit, and download SOPs
- ✅ No access to delete functionality

## Technical Notes
- Deletion is currently handled in local state (no backend persistence)
- SOPs are removed from the `sops` array in component state
- Changes persist only for the current session
- In a production environment, this would integrate with a backend API
