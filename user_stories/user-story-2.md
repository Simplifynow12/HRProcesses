#User Story: Onboarding Process / Procedures
As a new employee, I want a structured onboarding process so that I can integrate into the organization smoothly and confidently.

# Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format)
## Scenario 1: View Mission, Vision, and Core Values
Given I am a new employee in the onboarding stage
When I begin the onboarding process via the HR system
Then I should be presented with:
- A clear statement of the company’s mission
- A description of the organization’s long-term vision
- A breakdown of core values and behavioral expectations
And I should be required to acknowledge that I have reviewed and understood this content

## Scenario 2: Access to Company Policies
Given I am progressing through onboarding
When I reach the "Company Policies" step
Then I should be able to:
- View/download key policy documents (e.g., Code of Conduct, Leave Policy, IT Use, DEI, etc.)
- Confirm my acknowledgment and agreement (e.g., via e-signature or checkbox)
And my acknowledgment should be recorded and time-stamped in the HR system

## Scenario 3: Receive and Review Job Description
Given I have accepted my role and started onboarding
When I access my personal onboarding dashboard
Then I should be able to view and download:
- My specific job title and responsibilities
- Expected outcomes or KPIs
- Reporting structure and team hierarchy
And I should have the option to confirm understanding or ask clarifying questions

## Scenario 4: Structured Onboarding Checklist
Given I am an active new hire
When I log into the onboarding portal
Then I should see a structured onboarding checklist with:
- General onboarding tasks (e.g., orientation, policies)
- Role-specific tasks and resources
- Estimated timelines or due dates
And I should be able to track progress and mark items as complete

## Scenario 5: Welcome and Orientation Session
Given it is my first week
When I begin onboarding
Then I should be scheduled for:
- A welcome session with HR or team lead
- An orientation session covering company culture and internal tools
And these sessions should include a Q&A opportunity

## Scenario 6: Role Clarity and Team Introduction
Given I have completed the first few onboarding steps
When I reach the "Meet Your Team" milestone
Then I should be introduced (in-person or virtually) to:
- My direct manager
- My team members
And I should be given clarity on how my role fits within the team and contributes to company goals

## Scenario 7: Feedback Opportunity After Onboarding Week
Given I have completed one week of onboarding
When I log into the HR system
Then I should receive a prompt to complete a short survey asking about:
- Clarity of mission/vision/values

And my feedback should be submitted securely to HR
