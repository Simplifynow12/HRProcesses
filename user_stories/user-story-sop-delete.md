# User Story: Delete Standard Operating Procedures (Superadmin Only)
As a superadmin, I want to delete an existing standard operating procedure (SOP) from the system, so that outdated or incorrect procedures are no longer accessible to users.

# Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format)
## Scenario 1: Superadmin can see delete option for SOPs
Given a superadmin is logged into the HR system
When they navigate to the "SOP Management" section
Then they should see a delete icon (trash can) next to each SOP
And the delete icon should be red in color to indicate destructive action

## Scenario 2: Non-superadmin users cannot see delete option
Given a user with role other than superadmin (e.g., operations_lead, hr_manager, employee) is logged in
When they navigate to the "SOP Management" section
Then they should NOT see any delete icons for SOPs
And they should only see view, edit, and download options

## Scenario 3: Confirmation dialog appears when deleting SOP
Given a superadmin clicks the delete icon on an SOP
When the delete action is triggered
Then a confirmation dialog should appear
And the dialog should display the SOP title
And the dialog should warn that the action cannot be undone
And the dialog should have "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons

## Scenario 4: SOP is successfully deleted upon confirmation
Given a superadmin is viewing the delete confirmation dialog
When they click the "Delete" button
Then the SOP should be permanently removed from the system
And the confirmation dialog should close
And the SOP should no longer appear in the list
And other users should no longer be able to access the deleted SOP

## Scenario 5: Deletion can be cancelled
Given a superadmin is viewing the delete confirmation dialog
When they click the "Cancel" button
Then the confirmation dialog should close
And the SOP should remain in the system unchanged
And no deletion should occur

## Scenario 6: Multiple SOPs can be deleted in sequence
Given a superadmin has successfully deleted one SOP
When they attempt to delete another SOP
Then the same confirmation process should work
And both deletions should be processed independently
And the system should maintain consistency

# Technical Implementation Details
- Delete functionality is only available to users with role "superadmin"
- Delete button uses Material-UI DeleteIcon with error color
- Confirmation dialog uses Material-UI Dialog component
- Deletion removes the SOP from the local state array
- No backend persistence is implemented (demo environment)
- Role-based access control is implemented through props passed from App.tsx

# Security Considerations
- Only superadmin role has access to delete functionality
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Clear warning about irreversible action
- Role checking is done at component level and UI level

# User Experience
- Delete icon is visually distinct (red color)
- Clear tooltip indicates "Delete SOP" action
- Confirmation dialog provides clear warning
- Consistent with existing UI patterns in the application
