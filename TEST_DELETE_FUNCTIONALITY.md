# Testing SOP Delete Functionality

## Current Status
The delete icon should now be visible for ALL users (temporarily for testing purposes).

## How to Test

### 1. Access the Application
- Open your browser and go to the development server (usually http://localhost:5173)
- The server should be running from the previous command

### 2. Test Delete Icon Visibility
- Login with any user (superadmin, admin, hrmanager, or newhire)
- Navigate to "SOP Management"
- You should now see a RED delete icon (trash can) next to each SOP
- The delete icon should appear alongside the view, edit, and download icons

### 3. Test Delete Functionality
1. Click the red delete icon on any SOP
2. A confirmation dialog should appear with:
   - Title: "Confirm Deletion"
   - Message: "Are you sure you want to delete SOP '[SOP Title]'? This action cannot be undone."
   - Two buttons: "Cancel" and "Delete"
3. Click "Cancel" to abort the deletion
4. Click the delete icon again and then click "Delete" to confirm
5. The SOP should be removed from the list

### 4. Check Console for Debug Information
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- You should see debug messages like:
  - "App - loggedInUser: {username: 'superadmin', role: 'superadmin', ...}"
  - "App - userRole being passed: superadmin"
  - "SOPManagement - userRole: superadmin"
  - "SOPManagement - isSuperAdmin: true"

### 5. Test with Different Users
- Logout and login as different users
- Check the console to see what role is being passed
- Verify the delete icon is visible for all users (temporarily)

## Expected Results

### ✅ What Should Work:
- Delete icons should be visible for all users (temporarily)
- Clicking delete icon should open confirmation dialog
- Confirmation dialog should show correct SOP title
- Clicking "Cancel" should close dialog without deleting
- Clicking "Delete" should remove SOP from list
- Console should show debug information

### ❌ What Should NOT Work:
- If delete icons are not visible, there's a rendering issue
- If confirmation dialog doesn't appear, there's a click handler issue
- If SOP doesn't get deleted, there's a state management issue

## Next Steps After Testing

Once we confirm the delete functionality works, we need to:

1. **Restore Role-Based Access**: Change the code back to only show delete for superadmins
2. **Remove Debug Logging**: Clean up the console.log statements
3. **Test Role Restrictions**: Verify only superadmins can see delete icons

## Troubleshooting

If the delete icon is still not visible:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Ensure all resources are loading
3. **Check React DevTools**: Verify the component is rendering correctly
4. **Check Material-UI**: Ensure DeleteIcon is properly imported

## Files to Check

- `src/SOPManagement.tsx` - Contains the delete icon implementation
- `src/App.tsx` - Contains the user role passing logic
- Browser console - Contains debug information
